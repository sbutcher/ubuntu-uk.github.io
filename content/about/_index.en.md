description: >-
   We believe that everyone has something to contribute to the Ubuntu community. Whether you are a passionate user, a developer, or a translator, you are invited to get involved in the Ubuntu-UK LoCo. We aim to provide free community support to users of the various flavours of Ubuntu as well as advocating the use of Ubuntu to individuals and organisations alike. Ubuntu-UK LoCo is in the rebuilding stage. This is part of the LoCo rejuvenation that is happening throughout the world.
